Welcome to notion-echo bot!
This bot creates callout blocks into a page choosen by you in your Notion.
This will never store data from users:
https://github.com/fulviodenza/notion-echo

Usage
- `/help`: print this help message;
- `/register`: register your notion notebook in the bot;
- `/note [text]`: write the text of the note on notion;
- `/defaultpage [page]`: all next notes you'll write will go into this notion page, ensure to set an authorized page (this is done during the registration)
