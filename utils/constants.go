Here is how to get started:
	
- /help - Displays this help message;
- /register - Register your Notion notebook in the bot;
- /note text - Write the text of the note or upload a pdf, jpg, jpeg or png (for images and documents ensure to add /note in the caption before sending the media);
- /note --page "page_name" text - Write the note containing the text, on the page in the parenthesis ("");
- /defaultpage - Sets the default Notion page for your notes. Ensure this is an authorized page during registration;
- /getdefaultpage - Get default page you selected with /defaultpage page_name;
- /deauthorize - I will forget you;

If you send a voice note it will be transcribed to your notion, voice notes should not last more than 30 seconds.
